         I am originally from <b>Shanghai, China</b>, a vibrant and cosmopolitan city known for its rich history, modern skyline, and bustling streets. Shanghai is a melting pot of cultures, where traditional Chinese architecture coexists with towering skyscrapers, and local cuisine blends with international flavors. Growing up in this dynamic city has instilled in me a sense of openness and curiosity about the world.

         One of my favorite hobbies is traveling, and I have been fortunate enough to explore various countries. I visited Germany, Austria, Belgium, Singapore, Japan, New Zealand, and many more. These journeys have created lasting memories with my loved ones, as we experienced new cultures, tried different cuisines, and marveled at breathtaking landscapes together.

         Currently, I reside in <b>St. Louis, U.S.</b> St. Louis offers a unique blend of Midwestern charm and urban sophistication. The city is famous for its iconic Gateway Arch, beautiful parks, and diverse range of art and music festivals. I am excited to call St. Louis my home and continue exploring its unique offerings while embracing the opportunities it provides.
